hello world!
this is a text file to test the word counting program in c.
this line is longer than eighty characters, achieved by typing characters
there are several words and several lines in this file.
it was made using GNU nano.
GNU nano is a very basic text editor usable from bash, and it is much easier to use than emacs
thank you very much!
